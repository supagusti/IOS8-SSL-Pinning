IOS8-SSL-Pinning
================

A demo implementation of pinning a webserver certificate to an IOS app.

Credits go to Jay Graves aka skabber (https://github.com/skabber) and his SSL pinning demo (https://github.com/doubleencore/de-SSLPinning)

I've only done some modification of his code.

This project belongs to this http://www.supagusti.tk/mobiledevices/iphone-ipad/171-implementing-ssl-pinning-with-xcode--objective-c-on-ios-8 blog article in German language.
